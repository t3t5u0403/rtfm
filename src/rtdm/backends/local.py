"""Local Ollama backend.

This is the original rtfm streaming logic, now parameterised by URL +
model from config and split into three task-specific entry points so
the dispatcher can call them by name.

Design notes:

* We use ``http.client`` rather than httpx for the streaming path
  because the chat endpoint emits one JSON object per line and stdlib
  is already enough.  Pulling httpx in here would add an import for
  no UX win.
* Tokens are printed live to ``stdout`` and accumulated into a single
  string for the post-call clipboard / -x handlers.
* All three modes use the same ``/api/chat`` endpoint; only the
  system prompt differs.  Keeping the prompts in sync with the hosted
  service is *not* a goal — the local user is free to point at a
  different model that may need different framing.
